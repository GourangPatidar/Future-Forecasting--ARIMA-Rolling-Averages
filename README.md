# Future Forecasting: ARIMA, Rolling Averages, and A/B Testing

## Introduction

In this project, we delve into advanced techniques for forecasting future trends in time-series data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to apply and evaluate different forecasting methods to make informed predictions. Our focus is on three primary methods:

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Models**: ARIMA models are a cornerstone in time-series forecasting, combining autoregressive (AR) terms, differencing (I) to make the series stationary, and moving average (MA) terms to model the residuals. This method is useful for data with trends and seasonality.

2. **Rolling Averages**: Rolling averages, also known as moving averages, smooth time-series data by averaging values within a fixed window. This technique helps in identifying underlying trends and cyclical patterns, making it easier to analyze and forecast.

3. **A/B Testing**: A/B testing involves comparing two versions of an intervention to determine which one performs better. In the context of time-series data, this can be used to evaluate the impact of changes or interventions on the data trends.

## Methods

### ARIMA

- **Description**: ARIMA models are designed to capture various aspects of time-series data, including trends and seasonality. The model consists of three main components:
  - **AutoRegressive (AR)**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations.
  - **Integrated (I)**: Involves differencing the raw observations to make the time series stationary.
  - **Moving Average (MA)**: Models the relationship between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

- **Implementation**: The `arima_model.py` script demonstrates how to prepare the data, select appropriate ARIMA parameters (p, d, q), fit the model, and generate forecasts. Key functions include model diagnostics and evaluation of forecast accuracy.

### Rolling Averages

- **Description**: Rolling averages help smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends in the time-series data. By averaging values within a moving window, the method reduces noise and makes it easier to identify patterns.

- **Implementation**: The `rolling_averages.py` script provides methods for calculating rolling averages with different window sizes. It includes visualization tools to compare smoothed data with raw data and assess the impact of different window lengths on trend identification.

### A/B Testing

- **Description**: A/B testing is used to compare the performance of two different interventions or strategies. In time-series analysis, this can involve comparing two different time periods or two different methods to determine which yields better outcomes.

- **Implementation**: The `ab_testing.py` script outlines how to set up A/B tests, define control and treatment groups, perform statistical analysis to compare outcomes, and interpret the results. It includes tools for visualizing the impact of changes and assessing statistical significance.

## Results

The results section contains detailed outcomes from applying each method. This includes:

- **ARIMA Forecasts**: Visualizations and performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Rolling Averages Analysis**: Graphs showing smoothed data and comparisons with raw data.
- **A/B Testing Results**: Statistical analyses and visualizations comparing the effects of different interventions.

Find these results in the `results` directory for further exploration and insights.
