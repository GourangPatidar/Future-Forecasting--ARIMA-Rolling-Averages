### Future Forecasting: ARIMA, Rolling Averages, and A/B Testing

#### Introduction
In this project, we explore various techniques for forecasting future trends in time-series data. We primarily focus on three methods:

1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models
2. Rolling averages
3. A/B testing for analyzing the impact of interventions or changes in the data.
